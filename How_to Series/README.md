## My How_to Series

This folder includes some other functions that I explored and used.

I used Jupyter notebooks to play and try certain items and here, I have them as references for future use. 

Special thanks to Sally Zhang, a software engineer, who explained certain functions/helped me debugging. This allowed me to write those guides for myself.
